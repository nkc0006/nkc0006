My name is Nina Copeland and I am a graduate research assistant at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. My research focuses on applying the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to investigate changes in hydrology as a result of land cover/land use change in the Belize River Watershed. This research is in collaboration with SERVIR Central America.
